- Data: This is where we do all data-related stuff, like databases, external APIs, etc.
- Domain: The business logic and rules, the app's functionalities, are all in this layer.
- Presentation: This layer will consist of everything related to the UI or whatever is displayed to the users.
- App: This is the layer if we wanna put stuff like AppDelegate, SceneDelegate, or our @main struct.
- Core: This layer contains app-wide shared code like utility functions, constants, and extensions. The above layers can be used, but you should not depend on them.
